### Hey! I'm Ben.

I’ve been designing and developing websites for two decades.

I’m currently CTO at [The Boutique Hub](https://theboutiquehub.com) and spending almost all of my time building [Hubventory](https://hubventory.com/), a place for small businesses to grow and succeed. I'm very interested in helping businesses succeed by collaborating instead of competing.

In addition to my day job I build all kinds of websites, art installations, furniture, and embedded electronics. Contact me if you need some help with a project!
